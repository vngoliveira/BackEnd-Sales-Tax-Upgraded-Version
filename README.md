An application for tax calculation on product prices
<br/>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This program was developed to calculate the tax rate on taxable or non-taxable products, whether imported or national.
<br/>
For non-taxed products, books, food and medicine are considered. All other products types  that do not fit those mentioned above are taxed with a 10% tax.
<br/>
Imported products receive a tax rate of 5% on their value, while domestic products are exempt from this rate.
<br/>
Products are imported and taxed are taxed at both rates on their value. But national and non-taxed products are not taxed, remaining with their initial shelf value.
